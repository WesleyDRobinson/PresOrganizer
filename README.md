A platform to make PechaKucha Nights easier and more rewarding for organizers, presenters, and attendees.

More specifically, this is accomplished by the following:
giving presenters a place to upload images in a variety of formats and arrange their presentations;
giving organizers an easy way to create event timelines, edit them on-the-fly, and have strong control over audio and video output.

Expected Completion Date: 22 May 2015.
