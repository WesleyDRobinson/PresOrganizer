Knowing there are frustrating, low points of development, we wanted to choose a project name that might lift our spirits in those times. "jennifer" beat out "happy_fun_time"

A tool for uploading and managing presentation media. This version is specifically aimed at PechaKucha events where presenters agree to presentation constraints of 20 static slides fired at 20 second intervals.

We accomplished by the following:
giving presenters an intuitive UI to upload files and rearrange presentations;
giving organizers simple but powerful control of event timelines, edit them on-the-fly, and have live control over media output.

Some code we are proud of follows.

Wesley: The Upload Route! What I thought would be a 2 day task turned into a week of slogging through the AWS and Cloud Convert docs.
