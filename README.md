<hr>

This version is specifically aimed at PechaKucha events where presenters agree to presentation constraints of 20 static slides fired at 20 second intervals.

We accomplished by the following:
giving presenters an intuitive UI to upload files and rearrange presentations;
giving organizers control of their event timeline, the ability to edit it on-the-fly, and have live control over media output.
